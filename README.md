# Advanced-Computer-Architecture
simulation of pipe-lined architecture,cache added,super-scalar,branch prediction,...

phase 1 : implementation of mips 32 , pipeline mode , all branch predictions are not taken mode ,
data hazards are handled , no exception handling , no data memory delay

phase 2 : adding memory 3 clock cycle delay , handling all new data and structural hazards

phase 3 : cache added for reducing memory delay
